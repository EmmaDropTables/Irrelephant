          <li>Wild boars are omnivorous and easily adapt to changes. They were hunted in Europe from long ago for many of their body parts, and were shown in the mythology of many ancient civilizations</li>
          <li>mythology showed them as fierce, sometimes evil, while others showed them as brave, powerful animals. Again, others saw them as parasitic. Even today many people see wild boars very differently.</li>
          <li>The hair of the boar was often used when making the toothbrush until the 1930s.The hair for the bristles usually came from the neck area of the boar. </li>
